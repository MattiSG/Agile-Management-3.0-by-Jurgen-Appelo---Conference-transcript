Management 3.0
==============

Management
----------

Agile does not remove the need for an actual management.

Agile
-----

Agile is the middle ground between programming (chaos) and software engineering (order). It's acknowledging the complexity, between anarchy and bureaucracy.

Benefits
--------

Data from [State of Agile '11](www.versionone.com/state_of_agile_development_survey/11) (VersionOne survey).

Barriers to Agile
-----------------

From the VersionOne survey, the speaker draws the conclusion that most of the time, Agile failures derive from management.

Conversely, 77% of Agile tentatives are started by managers.

Management as a monster
-----------------------

Management methods are usually squares and rectangles. But management is about human beings, and does not fit peg holes.

The speaker presents his vision of management as a biological, 6-eyed “monster”.

### Energize people ###

Motivation is key.

Effective: 2-years with 0 turnover after Scrum introduction.

Artifacts:

- Motivator cards: write down key motivators, ask team members to order them. Proves that management **cares about motivation**, and allows it to lead accordingly.
- Happiness index: **materialize happiness** and the fact that management cares about it.
- Bell: hang a bell in the office, ring it when there is something to **celebrate**.

### Empower teams ###

7 levels of authority, from authoritative decisions to full delegation.

This concept frees the manager from the thought of delegation as a binary switch, either full control or full trust.

Artifact: delegation board, with pictures of responsible person(s), at the corresponding level of delegation.
    
    Delegation | 0 | 1 | 2 …… | 7 |
    -------------------------------
       Area 1  |   |   | pic1 ……… |
       Area 2  |   |pic2| ……… |   |
         ……

### Align constraints ###

Protect people: as a manager, sometimes you need to intervene when some team members don't work properly with others. Enforce human and technical guidelines.

Agile “values” are a small subset of all human virtues, and your team may have different ones. This is very important as a team building tool, especially to focus on _missing_ values, not the ones that come naturally.

Artifacts:

- Virtues list, from which the team can select (voting, consensus…) its **defining values**.
- Team identity: name, logo, mascotte, website… Leverages peer pressure via **pride**.
- Goal setting with **stories, pictures, video**…

### Develop competence ###

Don't hesitate to bring in external (or bring in internal) coaching. Coach ≠ manager!

The role of the manager is to find out **who** needs coaching, and then to delegate it. It is not your role to coach.

Training and certification: a certificate does not mean anything, but it can play some role. Analogy with the driver license: licensing does not mean competency, and can actually be dangerous in the beginning, since it can lead them to _believe_ they are competent.

Supervision / “patrol”: the simple _presence_ of the manager is usually enough to trigger responsibility.

### Grow structure ###

Main problem with most agile methods: scaling. What's valid for one combination of team/project/client may not be valid when you manage several ones.

Self-organized teams:

- let the team organize itself…
- …but give some constraints: skills diversity, team size…

### Improve everything ###

Artifacts:
- “impediments door”, or improvement backlog: a list of all impediments, the “manager's backlog”, prioritized by the team.

Scaling
-------

Split a big organization and its hierarchy and teams as several independent organizations.

The other way around, for small organizations, projects flow through teams (5±2 persons). Team builing and team responsibility is more important than projects acquisition. The teams may then face different POs, as long as they don't fight over interleaving priorities.

Most important: at least one year with a stable team.

Performance measurement
-----------------------

First of all: what is performance? Income? Turnover? …

Measure from the perspective of the stakeholders: for a client, it could be cycle time (mean time from bug spotting to fix); balance with team members’ important metrics, suppliers’…

The _metrics_ obsession is a view from Management 2.0: a dashboard of metrics that would give a “pilot” all information, so that he can drive the whole organization on his own.

Reference: Management 3.0, by Jurgen Appelo
-------------------------------------------

http://www.management30.com

Why 3.0? Beyond a selling argument:

- 1.0: command and control, as if organizations were machines that could be driven.
- 2.0: more recent, where management was extremely theorized… over a mechanical view of organizations.



Complexity thinking
===================

Abstraction
-----------

Temptation: _reductionism_, modeling.

Many problems:
- dehumanization;
- objectivation (believe one can be _objectively_ judge an organization);
- alineation;
- prediction (need for control);
- attribution (blaming people for problems);
- …

Opposite view: see _the whole_. But how far does _the whole_ go? Where is the boundary?

“Thinking in Systems” (ref. book): the limits depend on the question one wants to answer.

“All models are wrong, some are useful” // “All models are useful, some fail earlier than others”.

Complex adaptive systems (CAS)
------------------------------

A software development team is a CAS, just like many other systems.

_Complexity theory_ is about the dynamics of change in a system.

Complex ≠ complicated.

Methods
-------

- Diversity of models: complexity can not be answered with a single model, whether it is Scrum, or Kanban, or whatever. Multiple weak models are stronger than a stronger one, and applying a one-size-fits-all practice is not viable.
- Feedback (metrics…) should be given to the whole team, not only to management (information radiation).

Artifacts
---------

- “360 degrees evaluation”: peer evaluation, since only the complex system can evaluate itself.
- `CHAMPFROGS` (10 intrinsic motivations).
- Coevolution and subjectivity: as wrote previously, the simple presence of the manager influences the behavior of others. Work closer to others.
- FedEx day: learn a new skill (a technology, …), try to deliver something in 24h to present to others.

Research
--------

- Ashby's law of requisite variety.
- “All models are wrong, some are useful”.
- Steven Reiss, “The 16 basic desires…”.

- E.L. Deci and Richard
- Drive: the Surprising truth, Daniel H. Pink.

Questions
---------

3/interactions
--------------

**Should the answers for each group be planned or can they be JIT?**

Agile ➝ adapt, JIT.

**“listen to feedback” ⇒ How much do you accept to modify your offer to fit the majority?**

Compromise, no answer here.

4/identity
----------

**How to leverage peer pressure while at the same time integrating newcomers properly?**

Let a properly self-organizing team choose its new members, and it will take care of integrating them correctly.
